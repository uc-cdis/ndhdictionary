  gene_name:
    description: >
      Name of gene
    type: string

  high_confidence:
    description: >
      'No': Nonsynonymous SNPs that do not have high confidence of association with drug resistance as determined by analysis performed by ReSeqTB or are not listed in ReSeqTB. 'Yes': Nonsynonymous SNPs with high confidence of association with drug resistance as determined by analysis performed by ReSeqTB. 'Null': Synonymous SNPs associated with drug resistance in the literature but not entered in ReSeqTB.
    type: boolean

  hain:
    description: >
      Genomic single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are tested by the Hain Genotype MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays. The value will be 'Yes' if a patient's genomic sequence had a variant in a SNP that is identified by a Hain assay.
    type: boolean

  genexpert:
    description: >
      Genexpert MTB / RIF test to carry out the detection of the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a sample of diagnostic material and resistance to rifampicin in less than two hours.
    type: boolean

  snp:
    description: >
      Name of the single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been detected.
    type: string

  snp_result:
    description: >
      The result of detected snp. 0 represents reference allele, and 1 represents alternative allele.
    type: integer

  ncbi_sra:
    description: >
      Run code of the raw file in sequence read archive (SRA) that the snp result derived from.
